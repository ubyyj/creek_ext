## In English
This Repo demos use case of Creek, as well as sharing UDF, and also serves as a place for communication.

Creek is a **super lightweight** general purpose stream processing framework, it's implemented in Go. It provides Apache **Flink** compatible SQL interface, user declares jobs in a JSON document, no coding is required.

Creek takes **less than 10MB** of memory, hence it can run on most of the resource constrained devices, e.g. edge devices.

Jobs are statically linked to executables, so it has **no dependency** during runtime, therefore deploying it is as simple as download and launch.
